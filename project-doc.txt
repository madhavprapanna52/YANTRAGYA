# Project Documentation

Aim : Making an Working mini version for all machine learning mathematical computations by making mini version of numpy to work and do computations

# TODO Targets
  1. Making Basic vectors and matrix abstraction layers consisting of their all fundamental framework to work with
      Specific target
        > Make automatic matrix solving equations using known formulas for solving matrix dependecy
        > Introduce Least square approximation methods for proceesding for the further ML topics
            Requirements 
              + Transposing and other solving  unit to work for solving the least square equation
              + making matrix equation parsing engine for the solving of matrix
  2. Adding abstract interconnected concepts to the Matrix and vectors for easy framwork to adapt to for further development

  Specific focus
      -> Automatic Matrix based equation solving system
      -> Least square solving tool for Linear Regression system
