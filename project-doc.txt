# Project Documentation

Aim : Making an Working mini version for all machine learning mathematical computations by making mini version of numpy to work and do computations

# TODO Targets
  1. Making Basic vectors and matrix abstraction layers consisting of their all fundamental framework to work with
      Specific target
        > Make automatic matrix solving equations using known formulas for solving matrix dependecy
        > Introduce Least square approximation methods for proceesding for the further ML topics
            Requirements 
              + Transposing and other solving  unit to work for solving the least square equation
              + making matrix equation parsing engine for the solving of matrix
  2. Adding abstract interconnected concepts to the Matrix and vectors for easy framwork to adapt to for further development

  Specific focus
      -> Automatic Matrix based equation solving system
      -> Least square solving tool for Linear Regression system


Bugs fixing

Root cause : Using decimals and fractions for maping relation ins dependency parsing results in maping all entities together 
    fix   : Make strictly integer based maping of the numbes for  the respective collums which would limmit non terminating fractional relation
    Result : Ruining other dependent part to work unpredectibly 

matrix solving procedure to break down
Rank finding algorithm is broken
  Procedure for rank finding is to make sure its correct

  First learn about  the actual dependency thing in matrix situation to make and parse to find other elements ,
